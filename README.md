# NPInstanton: A Newman-Penrose Calculator for Instanton Metrics

We present a Maple + GRTensorIII-based symbolic calculator for instanton metrics using Newman-Penrose formalism. 

Gravitational instantons are exact solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations with Euclidean signature. The Newman-Penrose formalism, which supplies a toolbox for studying the exact solutions of Einstein's field equations, was adopted to the instanton case and our code translates it for computational use.

The program comes with three files:

- npinstanton.mws : The main file

- eguchihanson: Sample input file containing the information of Eguchi-Hanson instanton
  
- Tutorial.txt: Help file containing the primary information

- The file NPInstanton_for_Maple11.zip is the first version of the package that runs on Maple 11 and GRTensor II.

The article [https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0613](https://arxiv.org/abs/0711.0613) involves a review of the theory and the code.
