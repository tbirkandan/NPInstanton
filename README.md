NPInstanton: A Newman-Penrose Calculator for Instanton Metrics

We present a Maple11 + GRTensorII based symbolic calculator for instanton metrics using Newman-Penrose formalism. A limited version which can run in older versions of Maple is also available. Gravitational instantons are exact solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations with Euclidean signature. The Newman-Penrose formalism, which supplies a toolbox for studying the exact solutions of Einstein's field equations, was adopted to the instanton case and our code translates it for the computational use.

The program comes with three files:

(i) npinstanton.mws (or npinstantonjr.mws): The main file

(ii) README.txt: Help file containing the primary information

(iii) eguchihanson: Sample input file containing the information of Eguchi-Hanson instanton
